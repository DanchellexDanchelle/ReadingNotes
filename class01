This is a crash course to intro to coding for 'non-coders'

Let's say you want a sneak peek into coding but nothing too indepth. 
We'll go for something easy: Headings.
So headings are basically the title right ? So there are 6 levels of headers.
One being the biggest and six being the smallest heading. 
Using hashtags you can set the level. 
For example, if you want a level 3 header you would use three hashtags space and your title 
effectively looking like this "### Blah blah Blah"

### blah blah blah 

See its that easy now you're a baby coder :heart:
