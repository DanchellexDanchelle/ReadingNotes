## Before Wireframing 

Wireframing isn't the first step. You first need to know the audience and do your research. 

* Keep a record of your requirements, audience, competitor research,etc.

* choose a quote from you audience so that you remember what you are designing.

## Map It Out

Wireframing can get messy if you dont map it out.Mapping it out will help with user flow which simply mean how you want user to navagate the webpage.
user who are happy and trusting of the webpage are those who are self-sufficient. 

## beginning Wireframing

Dont get stuck on the small details like colors and fonts you should only focus on the actually outline.

After you have the biggest chuck of your framing done **NOW** we can focus on the *some* details. We are foucing on things that can help the overall navagation and build trust not the look. 

## Three keys to good Wireframing.

1. Clarity

- Needs to answer all of the quetions. What the page is ? What the user can do ?

2. Confidence
    - having a organizied page can give users confidence. your page should have a clean flow not unpredictable page popping up. 

3. Simplicity is key
    - keep the users focused with not too many links or unnessary information.

# HTML Basics

HTML is a markup language that gives your content structure.
HTML has elements to make your content look and act a different way. 
Enclosing tags are one of the ways that can happen.
We could use "<p> </P>" to make paragraphs in our text.

### Elements and attributes 

Elements can also have attribute names and values.
Attributes have extra information about a element that a code doesnt want in the actual text. 

Attributes that set a vaule **always** have:

- a space between it and the element name

- the attribute name followed by a equal sign(=)

- the attribute value wrapped by opening & closing quotation marks.

Nesting Elements are elements put other elements.
An example would be " <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p> "

With nesting elements please be sure that each elements opens and closes propely as above. 

Void ELements are elements that have no content. Void elements could the result of not closing a tag propely and not having inner content.

### Anatomy of an HTML Doc 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
