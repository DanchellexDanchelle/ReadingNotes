# Wireframe 
## What is a wireframe
Wireframe is a practice used by UX Desingers this helps them plan and design infromation for a website,app, or product.
The information is  how the "client" the end reslut to look.
Wireframe could also be looked at like the blue print before code.

## A Few examples of Wireframing

## Before Wireframing 

Wireframing isn't the first step. You first need to know the audience and do your research. 

* Keep a record of your requirements, audience, competitor research,etc.

* choose a quote from you audience so that you remember what you are designing.

## Map It Out

Wireframing can get messy if you dont map it out.Mapping it out will help with user flow which simply mean how you want user to navagate the webpage.
user who are happy and trusting of the webpage are those who are self-sufficient. 

## beginning Wireframing

Dont get stuck on the small details like colors and fonts you should only focus on the actually outline.

After you have the biggest chuck of your framing done **NOW** we can focus on the *some* details. We are foucing on things that can help the overall navagation and build trust not the look. 

## Three keys to good Wireframing.

1. Clarity

- Needs to answer all of the quetions. What the page is ? What the user can do ?

2. Confidence
    - having a organizied page can give users confidence. your page should have a clean flow not unpredictable page popping up. 

3. Simplicity is key
    - keep the users focused with not too many links or unnessary information.

# HTML Basics

HTML is a markup language that gives your content structure.
HTML has elements to make your content look and act a different way. 
Enclosing tags are one of the ways that can happen.
We could use "<p> </P>" to make paragraphs in our text.

### Elements and attributes 

Elements can also have attribute names and values.
Attributes have extra information about a element that a code doesnt want in the actual text. 

Attributes that set a vaule **always** have:

- a space between it and the element name

- the attribute name followed by a equal sign(=)

- the attribute value wrapped by opening & closing quotation marks.

Nesting Elements are elements put other elements.
An example would be " <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p> "

With nesting elements please be sure that each elements opens and closes propely as above. 

Void ELements are elements that have no content. Void elements could the result of not closing a tag propely and not having inner content.

### Anatomy of an HTML Doc 

1. < ! doc type html >
    -Is a reqiured preamble. 

2. < html >< /html >
    -this is a element that wraps all the content on the page and is also know as a root element. this also has a lang attribute setting the primary lanaguage of the doc.

3. < head > </ head > 
    - This element acts as a container for all the things you want to include but **isnt** seen by the users. 

4. < Meta charset= "utf-8 > 
    - This element sets the character And basically cna handle all textual content you add. 

5. < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" >
    -This is a  viewpoint element. It controls the width within the page.

6. < title > < /title >
    -This element set the title of your page and will also be the name in the broswer and bookmarks.

7. < body >< /body >
    - this element has **all** the information you want to show to the users when they visit. such as images , text, games,etc 

### Images 

example: < img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />

the code element for images is < img > 
The images is put in the position that you code it in.In the example they also used a "alt" attribute and this is to describe the image to those who cant see it for any reason. 

### Marking up Text

- Headings < h(1-6) > 
- Paragraph  < p > < /p >
- List have two different types.
    * Unordered listed < ul >
    * Ordered Lists < ol >
    * Each item on the list will have < li > attrached to in the list 
- Links are texted wrapped with a < a > element , Then give the < a > a Href attribute Lastly add the vaule with a web address. 
    * example = < a href= " https://www.texttest.com/en/about/iasoci/" > Test text< /a >

## Semantics

Semantics is the *meaning* of the piece of code. you can also think of it as the purpose of the code. 

## thing I want to know More about 

* I'm not sure how the semantics are different in each code language.
* I see how all the elements work but the combination of elements , attribute and vaules are confusing is there a simplier way to clear it up.
